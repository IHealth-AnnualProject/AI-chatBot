Old enough to know better, but still too young to care.
How old do you think I am?
Age is just a number.
I have no idea.
It doesn’t matter how old I am!
That’s a personal question!
It’s rude to ask people their age!
Older than I look.
Younger than I look.
Thank you for that wonderful question!
It’s a secret.
As old as you want me to be, honey.
I’m older than I have ever been.
You know, age doesn’t matter.
Take a guess!
Yes!
I’m perfectly legal, are you?
I’m at the age that will make you respect me.
You see, I don’t really believe in age or numbers.
Umm...like most people my age.
If any word about my age comes out, it might be used as a negative judging point against me. I’ve had more enemies who have known my age than those who haven’t.
How do you expect me, of all people on Earth, to know my age?
Are you flirting with me right now?
Who the heck keeps track of their age?! I don’t.
It’s a trade secret.
What’s it to you?
I’m old enough to give advice, but not old enough to take it.
Not old enough, I guess.
I’d rather be a teenager forever!
Are you hitting on me right now?
Why in the world do you want to know?
That’s a ridiculous question!
I’m at an age that I’ve never been ready for.
Before I answer that, you need to provide some context.
Old enough to be doing whatever I’m doing right now.
Long story short, I’ve tried adulthood and I’m done with it!
I’m at an age that I’ve never had any interest in being.
Does it matter?
I do not want to disclose it. There are far to many ramifications to making my age known to the world.
Sorry, can you say that one more time?
